  Tech stack: React 19, TypeScript 5, styled-components 6, Vite 6
  Component convention: each component lives in src/components/<ComponentName>/
    with <ComponentName>.tsx (logic + JSX) and <ComponentName>.styled.tsx (all
    styled-components). Styled components are never defined inline in the main
    component file — they are always imported from the .styled.tsx sibling file.
  Entry point: index.tsx using createRoot from react-dom/client.
  No window.confirm — use custom in-app UI for confirmations.
